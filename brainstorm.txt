For the course project, I am thinking to make something that I could put in my design portfolio since I am an UX Designer.

I am thinking to create a website where UX Designers can find resources to learn from. Particularly - great tutorials and life hacks on how to use Figma productively,
maybe some youtube videos that will help the beginners; how to prepare for an interview and etc.
Maybe even a guide consisted of topics from A(just starting learning) to Z (an interview process), as well as inspiring UX design portfolios.

I am not exactly sure how many pages will I need but I want to make the website as clear as possible without unnecessary content.

One of the APIs I will use for sure is Youtube one and probably Figma one as well.

Pages that will be included for sure:

Landing page;

Overview page;

Beginners guide (possible bootcamps to take, video introductions, "What to start with?");

Creating ultimate wireframes with Figma (video tutorials, personal tips and tricks, Figma designers to follow on Tiktok);

Interview preparation (what do you need to know? How to prepare? Some possible youtube videos with examples and preparation);

And I am sure there will be more pages that will come to my mind while creating the website.

The reason of my idea is to help starting UX designers to find all the info they need without spending too much time browsing online.
This was the issue I bumped into while learning Design and I know it would be super helpful to have some sort of guide to study and learn from.
